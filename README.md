### Translation
BlockPets has a language system so everybody can use the plugin in the language they prefer. You can change language to one of the available languages in the config.yml. Of course, not every language file exists. If you want to help translate, don't hesitate to add a new file and copy the english translations in it, then translate them. Any help is greatly appreciated.

### Features
- Pet spawning of most monster types and being able to remove them.
- Adjustable size, name, and player can be specified when spawning.

### Commands and Permissions
BlockPets has permissions for every pet and command, to wall off the permissions for players but still allow them to have at least some way to spawn pets. The most up to date list of permissions can be found in the [plugin.yml file](https://github.com/BlockHorizons/BlockPets/blob/master/plugin.yml)<br>

>BlockPets contains a hand full of commands to modify, create and remove pets. These commands can be found using the /pet \<help\> command. This command will list all BlockPets commands, and can show other information.
